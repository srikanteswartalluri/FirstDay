1. Print all variables and their types in DataTypes.py
2. Operators.py: write print statements for all other operators (ex: 10 - 2 = 8)
3. Operators.py: #TODO: please print "Hello Srikant" add a space in between two strings
4. write a program to find the lenght of a given string (don't use the builtin in function len())
5. take five integer variables and using if condition find out the biggest number.
6. Write a program to find whether two given strings are equal or not.

Difficult:
print a right angled triangle as shown below (take the no. of lines to be printed as a variable)

# Try to use loops (nested) and print pascal's triangle
#
#        1
#     1  2  1
#   1  3   3  1
# 1   4  6   4  1

#
# 1. Write a method named 'subtract' which takes two
# parameters i, j and print the result
# 2. Write a method named 'subtract' which takes two
# parameters i, j and returns result
# 3.  Write a method named 'subtract' which takes two
# parameters i, j , where j is default parameter(=5)
# returns the result
# 4.  Write a method named 'multiply' which takes multiple
# parameters i, j, k.....z  and returns the result

keep the code to print triangle in a method and pass the number of rows as an argument.
print_triangle(3) # prints 3 rows
print_triangle(5)  # prints 5 rows
